# Setup Tutorial
Setup support is only offered for MacOS with ARM64 chips.

While in the root directory of this project run
```
chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x build.sh
chmod +x compile_and_run.sh
```
in the terminal and then run the setup script which will install all necessary tools:
```
./setup.sh
```

Then you can compile the project by calling
```
./build.sh
```
and then running it via
```
./build/OpenGLProject
```

Alternatively you can execute
```
compile_and_run.sh
```
to execute it in one step.
